## Safeâ€™s post-it for Chrome

Safenote is an extension for the Chrome browser. It allows you to write a note for the URL you are currently viewing and save it on Safe. All notes are saved on Safe so using Safenote on another computer allows you to share the notes between them.

Keep in mind that your notes are also saved in the local storage of your browser. Other extensions or webpage can't access them but someone with an access to your computer could.
