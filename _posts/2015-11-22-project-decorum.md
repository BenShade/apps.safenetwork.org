## A Decentralized Social Platform for the SAFE Network

Project Decorum aims to deliver the freedom to organize and shape all your digital social activity in exactly the way that you want.

Its open source protocol can be used to create forums, comment sections, private communities, you name it.

Organize your social circles and manage your identities and personal data without any third party looking over your shoulder!
