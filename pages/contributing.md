## Submitting an App

Want to submit an app?

- [Fork this repository]({{ site.github }}/fork) on GitHub and clone your fork locally on your computer.
- Create a new post in the `_posts` directory and fill out the relevant
  YAML fields.
- Make a 750x600 thumbnail and drop it in the thumbnails directory. List its filename in the post's Markdown file.
- Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and other [dependencies](https://pages.github.com/versions/) with the command `bundle install`*
- Test out your changes with the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- When you're happy, push your changes up and open a pull request.

\* We recommend using [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to install and run Jekyll. To install Bundler, you must install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). [Click here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#requirements) for more info.
